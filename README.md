# Capture the Flag

## The Project
This is a **game** that I programmed with **Java** as a project in 10th grade for a computer science course project in 2018.

It is a multiplayer game in which two teams try to steal the flag of the opposing team. Each player plays as one of 3 different tanks with one of 3 different weapons.
